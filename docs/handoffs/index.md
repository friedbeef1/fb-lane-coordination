# Handoff Index

Use this file as the first read for handoff discovery. `PROJECT_BOARD.md` remains the source of truth for task status, ownership, sequencing, gates, and file locks. This index is routing only; detailed handoffs hold plans, rationale, logs, full QA, copy variants, and implementation detail.

## Active / Decision-Relevant

| Task / Topic | Lane | Status | Depends / Blocks / Gate | Checks / Evidence | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TASK-017 - Progressive disclosure + framework OKR hardening | FB-Tech | Staging QA | Product review of PR #31 before merge | Syntax, parity, tests, JSON parse, scorecard wording scan, lane status, validator, doctor, diff check | [TASK-017.md](TASK-017.md) |
| TASK-016 - Codex plugin handoff index | FB-Product | Done | Product review of branch/PR | CLI syntax, tests, parity | [TASK-016.md](TASK-016.md) |
| CI readiness automation loop | FB-Product | Done | CI readiness model | Local validator, doctor | [TASK-013.md](TASK-013.md) |
| Ponytail cleanup pass | FB-Product | Done | Maintenance guidance | Release asset checks, validator | [TASK-014.md](TASK-014.md) |
| Stable OKR alignment | FB-Product | Done | Loop Engineering model | Doctor fixture matrix | [TASK-012.md](TASK-012.md) |

## Historical Evidence

Open these only when investigating the named area or reconciling old Product decisions.

| Topic | Area | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin upgrade docs | Codex plugin | [TASK-Q-5624.md](TASK-Q-5624.md) |
| BFM return-loop closeout | Coordination | [TASK-011.md](TASK-011.md) |
| CI readiness automation loop | CI | [TASK-013.md](TASK-013.md) |
| Stable OKR alignment | Coordination | [TASK-012.md](TASK-012.md) |
| Maintenance cleanup | Cleanup | [TASK-014.md](TASK-014.md) |

## Index Limits

Keep this index compact. Do not put full OKRs, full QA checklists, plans, logs, rationale, copy variants, or implementation detail here. Put those in the detailed handoff and link it from the Detail column.

## Lightweight Handoff Metadata

For new handoffs, add a short frontmatter block when useful:

```md
---
type: fb-lane-handoff
task: TASK-...
lane: fb-product | fb-tech | fb-design | fb-business
status: ready | implemented | blocked | deferred | done
okr_fit: aligned | suggest approach change | blocked by OKR ambiguity
---
```

Do not retrofit old handoffs unless Product/BFM is already touching them.
